**ðŸ˜¸ PurrPal: Connecting Cat Lovers On Farcaster**

This is an incomplete project started at the Superhack 2024 hackathon.
The goal of the project is to create an interactive Farcaster frame inspired by Waifu, but centered around cat lovers' interactions and creativity. The application has several innovative features: 
1) Cat Gallery: Users can browse through a collection of cat photos with a simple click.
2) Rate & Engage: A feature to rate cat photos, engaging users by identifying community favorites.
3) PurrPal Connect: Matches users with similar tastes in cats, enabling them to connect and message each other.
4) Avatar Minting: Transforms cat photos or user profile images into manga-style avatars with the help of ChatGPT and DallE, with an option to mint these avatars as NFTs on Zora.
